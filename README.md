# The Game Box


-
This project helped me practice:

- Organizing user interfaces with clean transitions between windows
- Handling controls and events in an efficient way
- Building simple, fun interactions
- Structuring code and improving logical thinking

I won’t spoil too much—try it out and explore for yourself!
